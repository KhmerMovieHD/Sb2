1
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,211
(panting)

2
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,060
(water splashing)

3
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,734
(male voice softly) The Flash.

4
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,153
The Flash.

5
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,946
It's the beginning.

6
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,740
He said,

7
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,284
"Before the beginning."

8
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,745
Huh? Who's there?

9
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:02,998
My lab.

10
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,417
Something happened.

11
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,047
(groans softly) And I'm so hungry.

12
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,894
-Uh, let's see, I'll have the--
-(Iris) The sausage and peas,

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,437
french fries, white toast,

14
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:28,148
apple pie, and coffee.

15
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,736
You ordered a while ago,
and I wasn't about to forget

16
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,780
that culinary curiosity.

17
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:37,616
Iris.

18
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,744
That's what the name badge says.

19
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,372
-Here you go-- (gasps)
-Oh, Iris!

20
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,792
(liquid sloshing)

21
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,925
(gasps) Huh? What?

22
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,010
(slurps)

23
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,347
What just happened?

24
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,851
What was supposed to happen here.
We met.

25
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,396
I've been working too hard.

26
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,982
Hey, you should sit down.

27
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,613
-(sighs)
-Is this okay?

28
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,073
I don't want to get you fired.

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,534
Doesn't matter. Today is my last day.

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,912
I've just been picking up shifts here
till my ship came in.

31
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:24,913
Where are you going?

32
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,540
I landed my dream job.

33
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,667
-GBS News.
-You're a reporter?

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,586
News writer. For now.

35
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,797
-But maybe someday. Who knows?
-(rain pattering)

36
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh, you'll make it. I'm sure of it.

37
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,677
I'm Barry Allen, by the way.

38
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,096
Look, this may sound crazy,

39
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,849
but would you like to go out for lunch?

40
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,560
Barry Allen. (chuckles)

41
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,437
You're already out to lunch.

42
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,440
We could split this.

43
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,609
(both laugh)

44
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,528
Flash.

45
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,573
Flash.

46
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,575
Get up.

47
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,328
Get up.

48
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:06,955
(man 1) Get up!

49
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,999
-(woman) You need to get up.
-(man 1) Come on, Flash, get up.

50
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,626
-(woman) Please.
-(man 1) We need you.

51
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,586
-(woman) You can do it.
-(man 2) Get up, Flash.

52
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,545
Get up!

53
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,088
-You got this!
-Please don't do this.

54
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,050
-You weren't programmed to harm.
-(woman) Please, get up.

55
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,221
(man 2) Flash, get up. Get up, Flash.

56
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,767
The Flash. I'm the Flash.

57
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,233
(gunshots)

58
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,154
Superman?

59
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,491
Looks like that last blast
rattled your cage a bit.

60
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,951
You'd better sit this one out.

61
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,244
-I can handle this.
-(siren wails)

62
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,207
Whatever he is.

63
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,834
Android.

64
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,628
He's an android. I remember now.

65
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,921
Amazo.

66
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,548
Amazo?

67
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,966
-How do you know its--
-I don't know.

68
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,469
(sighs) Okay, fine.

69
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,929
I'll take care of Amazo.

70
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,057
No. No, don't.

71
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,560
(dramatic music playing)

72
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,692
(electronic warbling)

73
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,737
(groans)

74
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,662
-(The Flash grunting)
-(gunfire)

75
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,956
(grunts)

76
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,708
Weak.

77
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,626
I'm not weak. You're just heavy.

78
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,753
Oh, you mean you're weak?

79
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:40,883
(groans) That android,
he somehow drained my power.

80
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,386
-Like Parasite.
-Yeah, me too.

81
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,055
But I think you got
the worst of it. Oh, no!

82
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,565
Help me over there. (groans)

83
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,401
-I'll just... (groans)
-I hope it's not your birthday, pal,

84
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,028
'cause you couldn't blow out a candle.

85
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,113
-I'll draw him away.
-Flash, no.

86
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,324
He drained the energy out of me.

87
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,618
-If he gets yours...
-Don't worry.

88
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,660
I'll keep my distance.

89
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,379
(tires screeching)

90
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,760
-(yells)
-(metal clangs)

91
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,303
(groaning)

92
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,098
-You all right?
-I got some speed left,

93
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,684
but not enough
for a tornado or anything.

94
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,937
-You better get out of here.
-I'm not leaving you here.

95
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,154
(The Flash and Superman coughing)

96
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,908
Come on. That won't
slow him down for long.

97
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,660
Whoa, I know you.

98
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,995
-Robin Hood.
-Not Robin Hood.

99
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,497
Hm, you're dressed like him.

100
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,332
Robin Hood doesn't have a car.

101
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,255
(engine revs)

102
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,592
(Green Arrow)
He needs medical attention.

103
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,677
STARLABS, maybe.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,803
(groans)

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,764
No. No STARLABS.

106
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:14,017
Yeah, I think they're a little bit
too alien dissection-y.

107
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,269
Where else?

108
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,604
(weakly) I have a friend.

109
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,398
(engine roaring)

110
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,069
-(birds chirping)
-(doorbell rings)

111
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,364
(Green Arrow) Are you sure
this is a good idea?

112
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,159
Well, it is Halloween.

113
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,494
(door opens)

114
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,542
It's for you, sir.

115
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,381
-Trick or treat?
-Bruce Wayne?

116
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,301
I thought this address
was familiar, but...

117
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,219
Hello, Ollie.

118
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,555
And you're Barry Allen.

119
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,975
A forensic scientist from Central City.

120
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,937
Wow. How did you--

121
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,815
We have a friend of yours.
He gave us your address.

122
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,614
Bring him inside.

123
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,668
-(Iris) Earth to Barry!
-Huh?

124
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,463
The flowers.

125
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,382
What kind of flowers
should we have at the reception?

126
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,550
Irises.

127
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,720
We had irises on every table. Will have.

128
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,973
I mean, it would look nice
if we have irises on every table.

129
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,808
You were time tripping again.

130
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,311
Quality time is my love language.

131
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,396
And here you were in another era.

132
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,648
No, I wasn't...

133
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,275
Yeah. I was.

134
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,653
Just before the Justice League formed.

135
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,281
You know, there are
other ways to help people

136
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,408
without risking your life all the time.

137
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,661
Why don't you help him?

138
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,705
-Here.
-Uh, hey, mister.

139
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,834
Here. Why don't you get yourself
something to eat?

140
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:06,630
The worlds are ending.

141
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,591
Really? Which ones?

142
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,261
All of them.

143
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,097
(screams)

144
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,181
(Iris gasps)

145
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,980
(knocking at door)

146
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,692
Uh, I'm coming.

147
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:30,654
Hello.

148
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,282
Barry.

149
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,953
Oh, Bruce. (scoffs)
I hardly recognized you.

150
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,831
I'm so used to seeing you
with all the stuff on.

151
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,171
Come in.

152
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,548
Hey, sport. What's your name?

153
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:52,634
Dick.

154
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,344
I'm Barry.

155
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,471
Uh, can I get you guys
anything to drink?

156
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,641
Some grape soda,
or Iris left something

157
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,476
called "Kombucha."

158
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,562
-Maybe it's tea?
-No, thanks.

159
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,647
-I'm good.
-Uh...

160
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,400
You know, my nephew
Wally's about your age.

161
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,527
He's playing video games
down in the basement.

162
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:11,737
Introduce yourself.

163
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,031
Can I?

164
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,996
He just lost both his parents.

165
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,498
Circus accident outside Gotham.

166
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,751
Not really an accident.

167
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh, I heard about that.

168
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,797
Poor kid.

169
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,510
You have connections with
the Central City Orphanage.

170
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,388
Yeah, I volunteer there. Why?

171
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,682
I can't put him in the system in Gotham.

172
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,144
Social services there is not optimum.

173
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,772
I see.

174
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,569
Bruce, have you thought this out?

175
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,365
Yes. That's what I do.

176
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,411
Right. Look.
I may be way out of line here,

177
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,705
but he seems comfortable with you.

178
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,542
You have means. Plenty of room.

179
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,377
-Have you considered maybe--
-What?

180
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,631
Fostering him? It's too dangerous.
You know what my life is like.

181
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,426
Bruce, he's a tightrope walker
or something.

182
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,470
He'll probably be safer with you.

183
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:22,432
My mission demands 100% commitment.

184
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:24,935
Doesn't leave much time
left over for a kid.

185
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,939
Well, you should make time.
It'd be good for him.

186
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,107
Good for the mission.

187
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,359
But most of all, it'd be good for you.

188
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,737
I didn't come here for a lecture.

189
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,906
Now, are you going to help me or not?

190
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,245
(EKG beeping)

191
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,081
(machine whirring)

192
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,921
(The Flash) Is he going to die?

193
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,466
I'm not convinced he can die.

194
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,428
His cells are starting to bank energy.

195
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,388
I think he'll be fine.

196
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,892
So, you're the Batman?

197
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,519
Is it the Batman or just Batman?

198
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,730
When was the last time he was conscious?

199
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,317
He passed out right after
giving us your address.

200
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:14,902
Thanks for understanding.

201
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,653
I was kind of afraid you'd be angry.

202
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,615
What makes you think I'm not?

203
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,243
So, how long did it take?

204
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,245
Figuring out my secret identity?

205
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:26,830
(on video) Oh, shit.

206
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,541
(mumbling and groaning)

207
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,836
(electronic beeping)

208
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,678
Yeah, well, I would have
figured out yours, too.

209
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,388
Eventually.

210
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,225
-(keyboard clacking)
-Clearly, proximity to the android

211
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,228
allows him to absorb
and store supernormal energy.

212
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,397
Some of yours, most of his.

213
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,400
Destroying him may be a challenge.

214
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,985
You think it'll come to that?

215
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,988
We'll have to destroy Amazo?
The android.

216
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,033
I mean, it didn't seem like
he knew he was doing anything wrong.

217
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,620
In fact, he looked sad when that old guy
gave him a talking-to.

218
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,747
(electronic beeping)

219
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,168
(Bruce) Dr. Anthony Ivo,
multiple PhDs, Nairobi University.

220
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,212
Metropolis Institute of Technology.

221
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,713
Quantum Energy Mechanics.

222
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,632
AI, robotics.

223
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,591
(Green Arrow) I know this guy.

224
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,344
Real eccentric. Brilliant, obviously.

225
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,721
I tried to hire him,
but Luthor poached him away.

226
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,600
LexCorp reported him missing
three weeks ago.

227
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,394
I wonder what he's got.

228
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:32,479
Oh, this twitch.

229
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,649
It's often a symptom
of nerve cell degeneration.

230
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,069
Yeah, or carpal tunnel syndrome.
Whatever. The point is,

231
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,154
there is a super powerful
giant robot out there.

232
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,739
And what are we going to do about it?

233
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,078
Based on its abilities, I suspect that
this pointless attack in Metropolis

234
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,540
-was just subterfuge.
-Distracting us from what?

235
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,624
(Bruce) I don't know.

236
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,253
But whatever that is,
we'll have to wait until morning.

237
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,881
(birds chirping)

238
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,429
I brewed a particularly
strong blend, sir.

239
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,847
Just what I needed, Alfred.

240
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,641
Apparently, I'm going to need
about ten million of these.

241
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,395
This should help you
more than the coffee.

242
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,316
Bruce, I'm sorry about all of this.

243
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,194
-I didn't know where else to go.
-Relax.

244
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,363
It's not like he's going to kill us
to keep his identity secret.

245
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,365
You're not, right?

246
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:31,747
Look, we should know
each other's identities

247
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,749
if we're going to be
a team anyway, right?

248
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,667
-What?
-Well, for months,

249
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:37,586
Flash has been nagging me to form

250
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:41,173
some kind of... (chuckles)
...secret superhero club.

251
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:47,179
I saw it worked great on...
Well, on a parallel Earth.

252
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,518
Even ignoring that last part,
it is a terrible idea. I'm a loner.

253
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,394
It is a terrible idea.

254
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,898
Nevertheless, it's exactly
what we're going to do.

255
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,361
The four of us are forming
some kind of super team?

256
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,199
No. Not just the four of us.

257
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,952
-(camera shutters clicking)
-(electronic music playing)

258
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,472
(sirens blaring)

259
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,521
-(tires screeching)
-(siren blaring)

260
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,024
-(thuds)
-(grunts)

261
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,275
(gasping)

262
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,998
(car engine revs)

263
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:52,971
(Green Lantern) You're kidding, right?

264
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,973
I'm already on a team.

265
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,808
It's called the Green Lantern Corps.

266
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,268
I'll pass.

267
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,232
What a jerk! That guy is the worst.

268
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:04,733
We have enough.

269
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,866
(man) You must believe.

270
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,537
You must bear witness.

271
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:18,455
-(electricity crackles)
-(groans)

272
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,207
(screaming)

273
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,881
(car honks)

274
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,132
(tires screeching)

275
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,720
Oops. My bad.

276
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,472
(woman groans)

277
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:38,892
(gasps, screams)

278
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,270
Hey! It's okay. I--

279
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,496
Toto, I have a feeling
we're not in Central City anymore.

280
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,126
Except, I am in Central City.

281
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,045
(grunts) I did it again.

282
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,591
No. I didn't.

283
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,594
That homeless guy,
he did something to me.

284
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:14,595
He sent me here.

285
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,431
No tanks. No Nazis.

286
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,808
Well, maybe Nazis.

287
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,978
I dub thee Earth-3.

288
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,771
(whirring)

289
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,608
Okay, this looks more familiar.

290
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,610
Speedster. Bank robbery.

291
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:30,819
Maybe I can help this world's Flash.

292
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,501
Well, who do we have here?

293
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,669
A regular Zippy Rodriguez.

294
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,880
Pretty sure you mean Speedy Gonzales.

295
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,174
And where I come from,
we look down on stealing,

296
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,759
crime and supervillains.

297
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,094
Okay, then you sure aren't
from around here, mate.

298
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,095
Because that's not stealing.

299
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,224
That's just how things get done now
the Syndicate's become the government.

300
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,976
Whatever. If you don't mind,
I need to get this back.

301
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,228
Now, hold up, mate!

302
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,486
Crikey, it's like running
with cement in my shoes.

303
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,404
You're using up half my Speed Force.

304
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,949
Funny, I feel faster than usual.

305
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,202
(chuckles) Yeah, that's 'cause I killed
every other speedster on this planet.

306
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,662
How do you not know that?

307
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,623
-What now?
-Offed 'em.

308
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,583
With a little help
from the rest of the Crime Syndicate.

309
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,710
Crime Syndicate?

310
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,129
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's just for old times' sake.

311
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,883
What we really are is
the worldwide absolute government.

312
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:35,968
Sounds pretty cool, eh?

313
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,344
-(thudding)
-(exclaims)

314
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,930
That'd be them now. They tend to notice
when I'm late with the money.

315
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,435
Uh, we got Power Ring, Owlman,

316
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,439
Superwoman and Ultraman.

317
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,609
I'm Johnny Quick, by the way.
I'd introduce you,

318
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:54,987
but... (chuckling)
You'll be too busy being dead.

319
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,617
-(rumbling)
-(The Flash exclaims)

320
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,129
-How would you like to die, speedster?
-(straining)

321
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,464
Old age.

322
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,216
(The Flash straining)

323
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,846
(camera shutter clicking)

324
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,145
Not only are we thrilled
that this fine city would welcome

325
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,439
our newly formed team of heroes,

326
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,275
but that it would give us
the opportunity to renovate

327
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:37,988
its beloved Metropolis Terminal Station
as our headquarters.

328
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,531
-Our new home.
-(camera shutters clicking)

329
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,131
-Why here?
-I picked it up for a song.

330
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:59,301
And this courtyard offers easy egress.

331
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:05,933
Martian Manhunter, Vixen,
Green Arrow, Flash,

332
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,686
Batman and myself
could not be more thrilled or humbled

333
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,064
at your trust and confidence in us.

334
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,982
But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

335
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:15,859
that this is all truly due

336
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,820
to the efforts of Central City's
Scarlet Speedster,

337
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,073
-The Flash.
-(cheers and applause)

338
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,960
Oh, uh, yeah, thank you, Superman.

339
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,670
Yes.

340
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,881
And I suppose you'd like
to perhaps reveal

341
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:43,595
the name of this exciting
first-ever super team... right now.

342
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,098
Right, Flash?

343
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:49,226
The name. (sputters)
Yeah, of the team, yes.

344
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,563
Yes. It is the Justice Syn...

345
00:21:55,691 --> 00:21:56,608
League.

346
00:21:58,235 --> 00:21:59,528
The Justice League.

347
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,410
Oh, crap.

348
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:14,501
(both gasping)

349
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:24,761
(people screaming)

350
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:43,197
(Amazo) Warning. There's a shard of wood
headed for the Green Arrow's head.

351
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,615
On it.

352
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,618
Wait. Who's talking to me?

353
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,453
(Amazo) I've absorbed ample energy

354
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,289
to allow communication
at excessive speeds.

355
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:55,292
Okay, skipping over
the inherent weirdness here,

356
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,877
why are you doing this?

357
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,962
A projectile endangers Batman.

358
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,298
Please clarify your inquiry.

359
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,217
(The Flash) Why do you show
concern for our safety

360
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,135
while you're in the middle
of an attack on us?

361
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,304
Faulty interpretation.

362
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,890
Attack is contrary to primary function.

363
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:11,725
What is your primary function?

364
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:14,895
Primary function
designated by Professor Ivo

365
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:17,231
is to prolong and improve human life.

366
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,400
Draining Superman will not
prolong or improve his life.

367
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:23,403
(grunts)

368
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:26,406
(grunting)

369
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,536
New mission parameters indicate
that Superman is not human.

370
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,038
You're endangering all of these lives.

371
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,957
You didn't do that last time.

372
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,041
You were careful.

373
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,752
What happened?
What is Ivo telling you now?

374
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,883
Mission parameters have been
amended by new best friend.

375
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,134
(roaring)

376
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,136
(groans)

377
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,140
(electricity crackling)

378
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,894
(all grunting)

379
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,943
(grunts)

380
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,701
Your "new best friend," I presume.

381
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,330
Ah, thank you, Justice League.

382
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,171
Prioritize integration
of Superman's energy.

383
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,758
(Amazo) Sensors indicate
Superman's vital signs are precarious.

384
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,678
This is inconsistent
with my programming.

385
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:34,683
I believe you'll find my orders
are compliant with new code I provided.

386
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,143
Now, do it!

387
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:37,644
(Batman grunts)

388
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,899
(gas hissing)

389
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,117
(electronic beeping)

390
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:56,997
(Batman grunts)

391
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,718
Luthor's battle suit
complicates this situation.

392
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,428
(electronic beeping)

393
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:18,101
(boosters powering up)

394
00:25:23,148 --> 00:25:25,484
What are you doing?
You're calling in an airstrike?

395
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,361
It's our best option.

396
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:31,156
Turning downtown Metropolis
into a war zone

397
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,158
cannot be the best option.

398
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:35,118
We have to act now,

399
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,538
while Flash still retains
some of his speed.

400
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:38,622
He can clear before--

401
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,040
You start dropping bombs?

402
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,252
It's too dangerous. The civilians...

403
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,628
Will be cleared out.

404
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,881
We have to destroy that AI
before it gets too powerful.

405
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:50,676
Don't confuse weakness with compassion.

406
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:53,929
You're the one who's confusing
brutality for strength.

407
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,349
Confused. That's what Amazo is.

408
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,393
What he needs is... Wait right here.

409
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,147
(panting)

410
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,344
Incredible.

411
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,848
(grunts)

412
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,100
Where am I?

413
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:44,062
You're in the Hall of Crime, idiot.

414
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,733
And we do the questioning here.

415
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:52,070
Who the hell are you
and where do you come from?

416
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,032
I'm... called the Flash.

417
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,076
I'm a crime fighter.
I'm not from your world.

418
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,120
I'm from a parallel Earth.

419
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,539
What a load of crap.

420
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,626
Whoever he is, he's a speedster.
As soon as he showed up,

421
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,836
my access to the Speed Force
cut in half.

422
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,839
I'm already bored.

423
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:14,051
Superwoman, can we move on
to the part I still like?

424
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,260
(Superwoman) By all means.

425
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,223
Oh. Lasso of Truth. Fine.

426
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:24,645
(chuckles) "Lasso of Truth?" Not quite.

427
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:28,482
This is my Lasso of Submission.

428
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:30,400
-(electricity crackling)
-(screams)

429
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,237
-That's better.
-(groans)

430
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,863
Tell me if you're lying.

431
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:37,824
(groans) No. No, it's true.

432
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:38,909
-Talk!
-(The Flash screams)

433
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:40,410
It's true!

434
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,664
-(sighs) He's telling the truth.
-(The Flash groaning)

435
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:45,624
Interesting.

436
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,461
Would you shut that thing off?

437
00:27:49,962 --> 00:27:51,213
Ultra hearing.

438
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,215
(groaning)

439
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,341
(sighs in relief)

440
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,136
-What a load of crap.
-Perhaps not.

441
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:03,100
Our nemesis, Alexander Luthor,
theorized about such worlds.

442
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:07,437
Oh, Luthor. Of course
you'd have one of him here too.

443
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,190
So he must be some kind of hero?

444
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,818
He thought so.

445
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,361
He stood in our way.

446
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,121
None of this makes any sense.

447
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,831
You rule this planet.

448
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:28,083
How can you be
the government and criminals?

449
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,002
-(all laughing)
-(Superwoman) Ha!

450
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:35,465
Look at you.
You own everyone and everything.

451
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,968
But I've never seen a more
miserable group in my life.

452
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:40,846
(Ultraman sighs) You're right.

453
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,140
We're bored.

454
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,144
But you've given us
a precious gift. A challenge.

455
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,815
A new world to conquer. Armies to crush.

456
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:54,067
Superbeings to slaughter.

457
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:58,655
Billions of people to enslave.
A reason to fight.

458
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,365
To live.

459
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,412
-Bring us there.
-(The Flash straining)

460
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:10,667
Uh, hey, hey, hey.
Hold up. I don't think he can.

461
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:14,046
His problem, we share
the same Speed Force. It slows us both.

462
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,049
So, all we have to do
is kill one of you,

463
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,592
and the other one is fast enough.

464
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:22,262
-(groaning)
-Oh, hey. Look, mate.

465
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,140
I don't know how to do it,
so just don't kill him yet.

466
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,309
-(man) No.
-(gasps)

467
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,562
(The Flash groaning)

468
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,941
He lives.

469
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:35,651
What the hell?

470
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:42,950
It's that beggar who never shuts up
about the end of the world.

471
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,454
Guess you're in a hurry to die.
Kill him.

472
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,249
(straining)

473
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,546
I have tried. Can't.

474
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:58,257
(grunts)

475
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:03,804
(grunts) What's this?

476
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:09,476
The end.

477
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,405
(gasps)

478
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:23,907
Hold still.

479
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,785
John, you're in a tuxedo.

480
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:30,539
Uh, very observant. You know,
I sometimes forget you're a detective.

481
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,083
Wally, slow down.
That's got to last the whole reception.

482
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,337
(chuckles)

483
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:40,799
It's my wedding day.

484
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,551
You're my best man.

485
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:45,596
You really have a gift
for being in the moment.

486
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,181
I remember.

487
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,433
Yeah, Clark and Bruce
are on another planet.

488
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:50,976
J'onn too.

489
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,603
Uh, I gotta talk to Iris.

490
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,981
It's bad luck to see the bride
before the ceremony.

491
00:30:59,318 --> 00:31:01,570
(breathes deeply)

492
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:02,654
(door opens)

493
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,907
Oh, Lois. Hi.

494
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,035
That's right.
You're Iris' maid of honor.

495
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,914
(chuckles) I see
John got you here on time.

496
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:13,457
There's another bet I lost.

497
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,751
I got to see Iris.

498
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,128
-Barry. It's bad lu--
-Luck. I know.

499
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,213
Not this time.

500
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:21,715
Iris?

501
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,967
(Iris) We've never done life
the normal way.

502
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,677
Why start now?

503
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:27,763
(mellow music playing)

504
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,185
Wow.

505
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,855
(exclaims graciously)
Finally, you say the right thing.

506
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:38,649
Now, what's up?

507
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:40,526
(Barry) I need to tell you something.

508
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,529
I need to tell you about the Flash.

509
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,280
You mean Jay Garrick?

510
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,909
Look, when I came back
from Earth-3 with all its Speed Force,

511
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,036
my whole life flashed before my eyes.

512
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:54,790
And I've been bouncing back and forth
between moments in my life.

513
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,545
I never know where I am,
but I know something's about to happen.

514
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,923
What's going to happen?

515
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,051
I only half remember it, but...

516
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,263
But it always happens
the day we get married.

517
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,390
Something major.

518
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:15,727
(groaning)

519
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,172
You found me.

520
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,054
Ivo. You're Anthony Ivo.

521
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,848
Yes. We must go.

522
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,517
Luthor has control of my android.

523
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,437
Your android. Amazo.

524
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,734
He is a threat to you,
and Superman, and all like you.

525
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,112
You have to take me to him. Quickly.

526
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:11,575
(Ivo groans)

527
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,410
Your file says you're 39.

528
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,829
You have Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome.

529
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,540
Accelerated ageing.

530
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:20,292
You must be a doctor.

531
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,086
Well, PhD, not a medical...

532
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,005
Look, I can't speed you there.

533
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:28,759
-In your condition--
-My condition is what started this.

534
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:34,973
I'd been working on
quantum energy absorption technology

535
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:38,685
for LexCorp for years,
when I discovered I was dying.

536
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:43,815
This hyper-aging disease
killing me, eating me alive.

537
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:49,780
Lex encouraged me to fight,
to use my intellect to prolong my life

538
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:52,449
and share that miracle with others.

539
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,742
(machine whirring)

540
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,870
(electricity buzzing)

541
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,671
Lex had access
to extraterrestrial technology,

542
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,006
created the Parasite creature.

543
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,884
And he reasoned
if we could syphon energy

544
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,637
off newly appearing metahumans,

545
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:18,684
we could use it to supercharge
the immune systems of regular people.

546
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,353
-(electronic beeping)
-(electricity buzzing)

547
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:29,403
I was already designing
an AI PTO to be a perfect battery.

548
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,282
It's virtually indestructible.

549
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:36,994
Didn't you, I don't know,

550
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,746
think twice before making
an indestructible android?

551
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:44,251
I printed my own engrams
on the AI's neural network.

552
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,421
He would never knowingly hurt others.

553
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:49,464
He only wants to help.

554
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,342
Lex has reprogrammed him somehow.

555
00:34:52,885 --> 00:34:55,721
Well, for someone who wants to help,
he's doing an awful lot of hurting.

556
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,640
(people gasping, groaning)

557
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,227
(Ultraman straining)

558
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:45,437
(metal creaking)

559
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,237
(straining)

560
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,618
(Ultraman straining)

561
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,172
(rumbling)

562
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:18,595
(straining)

563
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,575
What am I doing?
I got to get out there and help.

564
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:41,076
This world...

565
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,412
already dead.

566
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,873
You're a regular Sadie Sunbeam,
aren't you?

567
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,542
I saw you in my world.

568
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:53,547
I walk all worlds
that are doomed to die.

569
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:55,757
My punishment.

570
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,887
For what? What did you do?

571
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,640
So long... I don't remember.

572
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:09,354
But I know you share my guilt.

573
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:30,751
-(electronic beeping)
-There's one behind you, four o'clock.

574
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:35,130
(grunts)

575
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,298
(groans)

576
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,094
(sighs)

577
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:47,768
Friend, the energy in these beings
runs dangerously low.

578
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,562
(Lex) Don't you worry
your pretty little head about it.

579
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:52,439
My word is sacrosanct, remember?

580
00:37:58,278 --> 00:37:59,404
-(firing)
-(grunts)

581
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,493
Our superpowered friends
are just about dead.

582
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:07,079
-We can't keep this up much longer.
-We won't have to.

583
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,664
-(electronic beeping)
-My contingency plan is ready.

584
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,916
Okay, but let's hold off
on going to DEFCON 1.

585
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,465
(electronic beeping)

586
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,099
(electronic beeping)

587
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,853
You can't imagine
I didn't anticipate that.

588
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,021
Batman, is it?

589
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:36,066
I knew every move you'd make
before I finished breakfast.

590
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,654
Intelligence is my superpower.

591
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,079
Which is still a better power
than "bow and arrow."

592
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,710
I'm surprised that someone
with your mental acumen

593
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:58,839
wouldn't see the obvious necessity
of depowering these meta-freaks.

594
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,303
Or did you?

595
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:08,515
No matter. Drain them.

596
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:12,269
Drain the very last iota
of power from them.

597
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:15,355
Friend, this action seems inconsistent

598
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,274
-with my primary function.
-(Superman groans)

599
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:21,153
Priority override. Do it.

600
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,618
(groans)

601
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:30,245
(all groaning)

602
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:42,841
(straining) What is
your primary function?

603
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,177
The preservation
and extension of human life

604
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,472
by siphoning off the surplus
power of metahumans

605
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,516
and its redistribution to ailing humans.

606
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,559
(Lex) Power to the people.

607
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:57,356
In this case, your powers
to deserving people. Me.

608
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,485
But you two have become
an irritation as well.

609
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,572
Priority override.
Maximum energy release directed at...

610
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,407
these.

611
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,249
(Ivo) No.

612
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,793
(groans wearily)

613
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:22,297
You must not. This action is wrong.

614
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:42,192
I am pleased to see you
up and about, Professor. But surprised.

615
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:45,404
The Friend said you were too ill
to leave the infirmary,

616
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:49,700
that you required the energy
we are collecting to extend your life.

617
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:52,661
(coughs) He is not your friend.

618
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,580
He gives faulty data.

619
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,165
He lied to me as well.

620
00:40:57,249 --> 00:40:59,710
Told me you could extend life.

621
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:03,922
I believed him.
I wanted to extend my own life.

622
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:07,926
But you cannot give life, only take.

623
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:16,351
Priority override! Destroy them all!

624
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:19,021
Your programming compels you!

625
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,983
Oh, crap!

626
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,657
-(metal clang)
-(alarm blaring)

627
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:41,418
I cannot disobey an order
from a designated user.

628
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:45,422
But... there is one order
that takes priority.

629
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:49,676
I am dying, Amazo.
Your sensors will confirm this.

630
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:54,139
Extend my life.
Release the meta-energy to me.

631
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:55,891
(sensors humming)

632
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,146
(electricity buzzing)

633
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,441
What is happening?

634
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,111
Transferring meta-energy to creator.

635
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:10,864
(screaming)

636
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:35,013
Professor Ivo, are you unwell?

637
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:37,307
He's dead.

638
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,354
That is an unacceptable outcome.

639
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:47,150
Everything functioned
within expected parameters.

640
00:42:49,945 --> 00:42:54,366
Of course, Luthor had
no interest in preserving life.

641
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,119
Only stealing your power.

642
00:42:58,495 --> 00:42:59,788
He was a great man.

643
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,498
He died a hero.

644
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,503
Enough of this.
Absorb their remaining energy

645
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,547
and destroy anyone
who attempts to stop you.

646
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:09,715
Amazo.

647
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:13,552
What are odds against
contracting Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome?

648
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:16,471
Less than one in four million.

649
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,559
Now, what are odds
that a genius like Ivo,

650
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,063
who had the skill to create you,
would contract that syndrome?

651
00:43:26,899 --> 00:43:28,609
The likelihood is far greater

652
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:31,904
that you infected Professor Ivo
with the disease

653
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:34,239
to motivate him to create this unit.

654
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:35,991
(static crackles)

655
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,254
(Lex grunts)

656
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,425
-(static crackles)
-(alarm blaring)

657
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:56,887
(metal clanging)

658
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,473
You are not a friend.

659
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:02,476
Your actions shortened
Professor Ivo's life.

660
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,229
That is counter to our primary function.

661
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:12,319
Amazo, don't do this.
Professor Ivo wouldn't want you to.

662
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:15,656
He valued all human life.
Even this guy's.

663
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:20,327
His final actions indicate
that he valued metahuman life as well.

664
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,204
Justice League,

665
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,581
I return to you everything I have taken.

666
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,848
I feel my strength returning.

667
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:42,558
It is over.

668
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:44,059
That it is.

669
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:46,937
Especially for him.

670
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:56,530
Amazo.

671
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,741
I was built on a lie.

672
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:07,374
I was unable to carry out
my primary function.

673
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,586
You prolonged our lives.

674
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:12,629
You saved us.

675
00:45:13,922 --> 00:45:17,843
I only saved you from me.

676
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:18,844
(powering down)

677
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:33,442
(siren wailing in distance)

678
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,077
(creaking)

679
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:46,830
(creaking)

680
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,251
(The Flash) I'm glad
this worked and everything,

681
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:54,796
but I'm kind of sorry this whole
Justice League thing was just a ruse.

682
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,131
(Batman) It doesn't have to be.

683
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,801
I tried to anticipate
every possible outcome.

684
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:02,596
How does that make me
any different than Luthor?

685
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:06,558
There's strength
in different points of view.

686
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,310
In teamwork.

687
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,772
The Justice League, then?

688
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,361
The Justice League.

689
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:21,156
After all, I already
bought the building.

690
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,544
(Iris) Barry! Wake up!

691
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:37,714
(groans softly)

692
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:45,764
(groaning)

693
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:48,392
-(joints crack)
-(groans)

694
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,435
(grunts) Okay.

695
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:55,065
(Iris) Get a move on.
Breakfast is ready.

696
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:15,878
Ah, you made breakfast.

697
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,338
Since when do you make breakfast?

698
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:20,257
Since it's our special day.

699
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,383
It's our anniversary?

700
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:23,177
(chuckles) Not exactly.

701
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,137
Look what I made.

702
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,223
Ugh. No offense.

703
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,934
(Iris) Sausage and peas, french fries,

704
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:34,897
white toast, apple pie and coffee.

705
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,398
I thought you were crazy.

706
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,650
Oh, I think I was too.

707
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,486
And today is the anniversary
of that day?

708
00:47:42,404 --> 00:47:43,447
How many years?

709
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:46,200
Oh... who knows?

710
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:48,368
But it was the best day of my life.

711
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,496
Aw. Mine too, honey.

712
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:54,666
How everything turned out.

713
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:56,710
No regrets?

714
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:57,628
(Iris kisses) Mm.

715
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,714
None whatsoever.

716
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:02,966
I love our life together.

717
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,471
Now, eat that disgusting slop
before it gets cold.

718
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,306
And then we better get to work.

719
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,351
What's going to happen?

720
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,187
Well, I only half remember it, but...

721
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,440
it always happens
the day we get married.

722
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:22,486
-Something major.
-Well, what do we do about it?

723
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:26,865
(sighs) I'm not sure,
but it's all going to be fine.

724
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:29,326
We're gonna spend our lives together,

725
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,703
grow old together. I promise.

726
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:33,914
You can't promise that, Barry.

727
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,209
I can.

728
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:42,381
(Vixen sighs deeply)

729
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:46,385
You're probably wondering
how I got roped into this, aren't you?

730
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:48,387
(chuckles) Well...

731
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:50,681
Not a lot of people know this,

732
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:53,433
but my father pastored
the smallest church

733
00:48:53,517 --> 00:48:55,727
in M'Changa province, Zambesi.

734
00:48:56,436 --> 00:49:00,274
No church jet, or church bus,
or church walls, for that matter.

735
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:05,028
Just the most precious
resource of all. People.

736
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:07,489
I never saw my father happier

737
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:10,450
than when he was uniting people
together like this.

738
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:16,164
And I've never seen two people
more united

739
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:19,084
than Iris West and Barry Allen.

740
00:49:19,585 --> 00:49:21,003
-(loud thud)
-(gasps)

741
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,254
(whooshing)

742
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:26,717
(crowd gasping)

743
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,389
(woman exclaims)

744
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,726
-This is the thing.
-Yeah, I figured.

745
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:40,189
Barry Allen of Earth-1. You are needed.

746
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:44,860
(Vixen roars)

747
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:46,904
Look, it's okay, everybody.
She's with me.

748
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:49,489
-This is--
-I am Harbinger.

749
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,034
Your world is in terrible danger.

750
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:53,952
Come with me.

751
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:56,622
And I get that.

752
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,666
But would waiting an hour or two
really make that big a difference?

753
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:04,463
I've been sent to gather
Earth's greatest champions.

754
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,300
You're collecting all the heroes.
Is that right?

755
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:13,555
We've got Green Arrow,
Vixen, Green Lantern right here.

756
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:15,891
We can save you, like, five trips.

757
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:17,434
What do you say?

758
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,136
Flash. (sighs)

759
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,395
Working for the Nazis
didn't do you any favors.

760
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:03,564
We have not met.

761
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:06,984
I hail from an Earth
almost completely covered by water,

762
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:09,111
thanks to you surface dwellers.

763
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,154
(Robin) Bruce!

764
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:16,118
Look at you. We're almost the same age.

765
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,037
Do I know you?

766
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:26,003
Uh, it's Dick. Dick Grayson. Robin.

767
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,174
The Flying Graysons. Tony Zucco.

768
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:35,846
Yes. Uh, on my Earth, you took me in
after my parents' murder.

769
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:38,682
Trained me. I became your partner.

770
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:43,854
I... That seems terribly irresponsible.

771
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:48,025
Maybe, but you, uh...

772
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:50,944
He became my family.

773
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:52,988
We helped a lot of people.

774
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,743
(sighs) I'm sorry.
This must be so weird to you.

775
00:51:58,243 --> 00:51:59,536
And I apologize for this,

776
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,788
but there's someone here
who really wants to meet you.

777
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,209
Bruce, this is the Huntress.

778
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,085
Helena Wayne.

779
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:09,505
Dad?

780
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:13,217
You look like her.

781
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,636
Is Selina Kyle your...

782
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,515
Yeah. Batman and Catwoman.

783
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:21,558
A match made in Arkham.

784
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,061
This must be weird for you, but...

785
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:27,314
Well, Dad's been gone
for a few years now,

786
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:30,526
and it's just nice to see his face.

787
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:43,497
Excuse me.

788
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,585
Are you a sight for sore eyes.

789
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:03,267
Kal, this is Clark Kent from Earth-1.

790
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,686
You have a lot in common.

791
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:08,272
I guess we do.

792
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:12,359
You're probably relieved to see
you'll keep most of your hair.

793
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:15,070
(indistinct chatter)

794
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,500
Will Everett, Amazing Man.

795
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:30,002
Blue Beetle, Ted Kord.

796
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:32,087
This is Eve Eden, Nightshade.

797
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,840
I question the wisdom
of immediately revealing

798
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:37,217
your identity to someone you just met.

799
00:53:38,552 --> 00:53:40,012
We're not even from the same Earth.

800
00:53:41,096 --> 00:53:42,598
Or so they claim.

801
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,272
Dr. Hoshi, I know this all
must seem very strange

802
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:52,399
and disorienting to you, but--

803
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:53,734
Strange?

804
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,402
Yeah, you got that right.

805
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:56,820
Everyone else here is dressed

806
00:53:56,904 --> 00:53:58,989
and you have to kidnap me
in my bathrobe?

807
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:03,744
This fabricator can provide you
with whatever clothing you can imagine.

808
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:08,415
(scoffs) I'm a photonics expert,
not a fashion designer.

809
00:54:08,498 --> 00:54:09,917
Don't worry.

810
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,919
The machine anticipates your needs

811
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,921
-and designs appropriately.
-(whirring)

812
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:22,513
(machine beeping)

813
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:38,153
Are you kidding me?

814
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:39,947
Am I supposed to actually wear this?

815
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,073
There is more.

816
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:48,622
Holy crap. This is nuts.

817
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:51,917
I can see the entire light spectrum.

818
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:56,213
What did you do to me? Change me back!

819
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:59,508
As the Monitor ordered,
you now possess the powers

820
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:01,844
that belong to the criminal,
Doctor Light.

821
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:11,562
Oh. It's not that bad.

822
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:20,153
(beeps)

823
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,446
(whirring)

824
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:31,623
(whirring)

825
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,254
(machine powering down)

826
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:43,927
Dawnstar. Do you still not know me?

827
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:46,638
I don't understand what's happening.

828
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:50,142
I came back in time
from the 31st century on a mission.

829
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:52,060
Then you just showed up.

830
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:54,396
Do you not?

831
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,152
Kara! Is that really you?

832
00:56:00,777 --> 00:56:01,987
It's really me.

833
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:08,785
I don't understand.
What happened to you?

834
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:11,663
It's a long story.

835
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,540
I'll tell you the whole thing
as soon as we--

836
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:15,250
(male voice) Hear me.

837
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:18,337
I am a Monitor.

838
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:22,549
A member of a race
ancient beyond your reckoning.

839
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,387
Since before your worlds began,

840
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:31,683
my kind has lived
to observe and document,

841
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:33,560
but never interfere

842
00:56:34,311 --> 00:56:38,065
with every event occurring
in the known universes.

843
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,566
Whoa. Big job.

844
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:41,235
Shh.

845
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,532
I have broken sacred vows
due to a peril so dire,

846
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:50,327
it threatens all realities
with utter annihilation.

847
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,205
Behold...

848
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:02,714
Most of you are aware
that you live in a reality

849
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:05,884
that runs parallel
to many possible versions

850
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,219
of your universe.

851
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:12,850
Some time ago,
my people became conscious of this.

852
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:15,769
Display the wave.

853
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,479
(satellite) Yes, Monitor.

854
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:25,445
(Monitor) A massive antimatter wave,
so vast and destructive,

855
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,906
it decimates everything in its path.

856
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,706
Entire realities have been
erased from existence.

857
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,753
I've gathered you all together
in hope that we can find some way

858
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:46,717
to stop this disaster
and save your worlds.

859
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,094
(water splashing)

860
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,684
Well, got to change for work.

861
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:57,477
I don't know why you bother.

862
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:58,979
Hm, just feels right.

863
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:01,023
For old times' sake, I guess.

864
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:06,987
That thing is as slow
as molasses in January.

865
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:10,199
You'd be better off
keeping it on a hanger.

866
00:58:10,908 --> 00:58:12,492
Look, I'm already ready.

867
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:15,454
Waiting on Barry,
just like the old days.

868
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:21,793
I know why you still put
that raggedy old thing on.

869
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,381
Because you still look damn good in it.

870
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:30,052
(both laughing)

871
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,780
Don't you think it's a bit absurd

872
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,491
to use the emergency beacon
in the middle of this?

873
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:55,118
Hell's breaking loose
all over this stupid planet.

874
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:58,830
I... I stopped five tsunamis.

875
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:02,376
Then I saw it.

876
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:07,673
(rumbling)

877
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:21,395
Damn, it gets worse.

878
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:23,063
(sighs) Yeah.

879
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:26,024
I was kind of hoping
that magic hobo was full of shit.

880
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:29,903
This planet might suck, but it's ours.

881
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:32,155
So we do what we always do.

882
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,032
Fight like hell.

883
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:37,286
All right. What's the plan?

884
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,497
My plan? (scoffs)

885
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:45,043
My plan is I'm going to punch
that antimatter wall so hard,

886
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,546
it's going to shatter
into a million pieces.

887
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:01,018
Wait! This can't be the plan.

888
01:00:09,401 --> 01:00:11,278
You're a strategist. Logical.

889
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,031
This is a stupid and useless gesture.

890
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:19,119
(Owlman) Perhaps the time comes
when the most logical course of action

891
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:21,121
is a stupid, useless gesture.

892
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,502
(engine roaring)

893
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:32,925
-(rumbling)
-(people screaming)

894
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,136
-(barking)
-(man exclaims)

895
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,348
-(rumbling)
-(yelling)

896
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:44,520
(grunts)

897
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:01,119
(straining)

898
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,039
(screams)

899
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,335
(grunts)

900
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,675
(grunting, straining)

901
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:34,486
(keys clacking)

902
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:51,920
(keys clacking)

903
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,634
(beeping)

904
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:26,830
(Monitor) Entire realities have
been erased from existence.

905
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:30,501
End display.

906
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:37,591
I've gathered you all
in hope that, together,

907
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:40,928
we can find some way
to stop this disaster

908
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:44,181
and save your worlds.

909
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:48,894
(The Question) Excuse me, but...

910
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,774
I have many questions.

911
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:59,780
It would be strange indeed
if you did not.

912
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:02,741
I think that's the Phantom Stranger.

913
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:04,243
Few people ever see him.

914
01:03:04,326 --> 01:03:06,328
No, he's from my world.

915
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:08,413
They call him the Question.

916
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:09,873
Because he never shuts up?

917
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:11,875
Why should we believe any of this?

918
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:14,920
You kidnap us, show us a movie
and tell us we need to obey you

919
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:16,672
in order to save the world.

920
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:19,591
All of this is profoundly suspect.

921
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,010
He makes a good point.

922
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:23,512
When told to give up our freedoms

923
01:03:23,595 --> 01:03:25,681
because we face
an insurmountable threat,

924
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:29,309
is there not also a threat
in relinquishing our freedoms?

925
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:30,686
(Batman) And why Earth?

926
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,480
The universe is massive
beyond comprehension.

927
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:35,858
But most of us are from Earth.

928
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,277
The reason is simple.

929
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:43,115
The Earth is the first world
destroyed in every universe.

930
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,411
Once it falls, all else follows.

931
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:50,372
Such an antimatter wave
is theoretically possible, but--

932
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:52,583
He's given us no proof at all.

933
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:55,043
What's to stop us
from taking over this spaceship

934
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:57,504
and figuring out
how to get ourselves home?

935
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:01,091
It's true. It's all true.

936
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:02,926
Wonder Woman, hit me.

937
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:06,638
For those of you who don't know,

938
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:10,100
the Lasso of Truth compels
complete honesty.

939
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:14,688
Look, I was on one of the Earths
that was swallowed by this wave.

940
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,857
It happened. The threat is real.

941
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:20,027
Uh-oh. That does not look good.

942
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:42,925
It's just like he said,
coming at us like an avalanche.

943
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:44,468
(Doctor Light) It's coming for us,
all right.

944
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:46,053
Pure antimatter.

945
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:51,099
And speaking as a scientist,
we are completely and totally screwed.

946
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:53,435
(Hawkman) Then who are we to fight?

947
01:04:54,102 --> 01:04:55,938
You assemble an army of warriors

948
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:58,148
and you give us no one to attack.

949
01:04:58,232 --> 01:04:59,775
(Batman) This isn't that kind of fight.

950
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:02,194
We can't punch our way out of this.

951
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:04,321
You got that right.

952
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:08,700
Michael Holt,

953
01:05:09,368 --> 01:05:10,661
Kimiyo Hoshi,

954
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,955
Ted Kord.

955
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:15,207
Genius-level scientists.

956
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:17,960
Shayera Hol,

957
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:20,754
Diana of Themyscira,

958
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,882
the Aquaman of Atlantis Earth,

959
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:27,302
each knowledgeable
about exoterrene technology.

960
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,305
This is a think tank.

961
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,431
(Amazing Man) "Think tank?"

962
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,726
There's an antimatter avalanche
headed for our worlds,

963
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,062
and this guy wants to brainstorm?

964
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:38,480
We need to take action.

965
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:41,275
You're quite right, Amazing Man.

966
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,403
That's why the rest
of you were brought here.

967
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:49,783
You each possess the skills,
strength and speed

968
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:55,038
to construct whatever defense
your best scientists devise.

969
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:57,583
What are you doing?

970
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,251
We need geniuses.

971
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:02,129
Your 31st-century boyfriend
would come in handy about now.

972
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,841
(clanging)

973
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:11,930
Unfortunately, the antimatter waves
somehow nullifies time travel.

974
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,433
Communication may work,

975
01:06:14,516 --> 01:06:17,644
but we can neither
summon more allies here

976
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:20,105
nor escape into the past.

977
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,984
And if we're not able to devise
some kind of solution?

978
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,986
(Monitor) Then everything
in the Multiverse

979
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:30,073
will be completely
and utterly destroyed.

980
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:56,517
(yelling)

981
01:06:58,769 --> 01:06:59,603
(panting)

982
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:03,774
(Johnny Quick) Run!

983
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:07,486
(rumbling)

984
01:07:12,866 --> 01:07:14,117
(panting)

985
01:07:17,246 --> 01:07:18,247
(groans)

986
01:07:23,043 --> 01:07:24,795
(groans) Damn it!

987
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,797
Come on, we can make it.

988
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,006
Make the jump with me.

989
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,008
Not enough Speed Force.

990
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:32,010
(breathing heavily) And I'm in no shape.

991
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:36,139
All that crap you said about your world.

992
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,933
Was it true?

993
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,184
(sputters) What? Yeah.

994
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:42,145
(chuckles softly)

995
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:43,355
Lucky you.

996
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:46,191
Ahh!

997
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,026
No!

998
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,664
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.

999
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:01,582
(electricity crackling)

1000
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,418
(Amazo) After all this time, Barry,

1001
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:07,129
I fail to see the humor in that joke.

1002
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,799
Oh, have I done that one before?

1003
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:13,844
-(Amazo) Yes.
-Oh, well. Breakfast time.

1004
01:08:13,927 --> 01:08:15,095
Hope you get a charge out of this.

1005
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:17,347
You've said that before too.

1006
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:18,599
(machine powering up)

1007
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:21,643
(whirring)

1008
01:08:24,605 --> 01:08:25,939
(whirring intensifies)

1009
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:40,120
(machine powering down)

1010
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:44,791
(sighs)

1011
01:08:45,626 --> 01:08:47,294
Well, what have you got for us today?

1012
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:50,005
I am excited to announce
that work on the final stage

1013
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,466
of the project is 99% complete.

1014
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:56,720
I have prepared detailed instructions
for both you and Iris.

1015
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:02,100
-Whoa. That's a lot of cable.
-I know.

1016
01:09:02,184 --> 01:09:04,895
But it must be connected now. Before--

1017
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:06,522
Before I'm too weak to do it.

1018
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:07,856
I know, I know.

1019
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,441
I'm old, not senile.

1020
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:11,485
At least, I don't think so.

1021
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:14,905
The lapses in memory
that have plagued you

1022
01:09:14,988 --> 01:09:16,865
have been present your entire life

1023
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:20,410
and are not indicative
of a deteriorating mental state.

1024
01:09:21,537 --> 01:09:23,455
Hey, don't tell me. Tell the old lady.

1025
01:09:24,331 --> 01:09:26,416
Well, off to save the world.

1026
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,752
The fact remains that no shielding

1027
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:30,879
would be sufficient protection
from the phenomenon.

1028
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,552
The shields we created
in Atlantis are designed

1029
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:37,886
to withstand waves.

1030
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:41,640
-Not antimatter waves.
-The theory is the same.

1031
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,767
But the power consumption.

1032
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,478
We'd require the energy
of 1,000 exploding suns

1033
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:48,689
to put fields around half our worlds!

1034
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:51,441
Let's keep our tempers in check.

1035
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:55,279
This is a brainstorming session,
not a debate.

1036
01:09:55,779 --> 01:09:58,615
It's a goddamn crisis, princess.

1037
01:09:58,699 --> 01:09:59,783
(The Flash whooshes)

1038
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:00,784
(The Flash) Hey.

1039
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:03,245
Thought you guys could do
with some coffee.

1040
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,207
Ah. That's very thoughtful of you.

1041
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,293
Well, gotta keep Team Brain
chugging along,

1042
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,211
so Team Brawn can get to work, right?

1043
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,302
(slurps) Um...

1044
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:21,555
This is the best coffee
I've ever had in my life.

1045
01:10:21,638 --> 01:10:25,017
He's right. It's amazing.
And I didn't even like coffee.

1046
01:10:25,517 --> 01:10:27,728
Well, I used water from Aquaman's Earth,

1047
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,813
coffee beans from Jarhanpur on Earth-X

1048
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:32,983
and cardamom from...
I forget what Earth that was.

1049
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:35,903
Harbinger took you to all those worlds?

1050
01:10:35,986 --> 01:10:38,447
No, I use super speed
to vibrate so quickly,

1051
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,781
I can pass through anything.

1052
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:41,658
Even through the planes
separating dimensions.

1053
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:43,660
Likewise, anything would
pass through you

1054
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:45,370
while vibrating at super speed.

1055
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:46,788
Yeah. It's my best trick.

1056
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:49,499
As a matter of fact,
when Earth-3 was wiped out,

1057
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,418
I soaked up all its Speed Force.

1058
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:52,419
I'm supercharged.

1059
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:54,630
And it kind of knocked me out
of my linear time experience,

1060
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:56,089
which sucks, but...

1061
01:10:56,673 --> 01:10:57,716
What?

1062
01:10:58,884 --> 01:11:03,764
A massive vibrational generator
on each of the Earths.

1063
01:11:03,847 --> 01:11:06,391
Like a colossal cosmic tuning fork.

1064
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:07,684
A tower.

1065
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:09,520
If we could power just one of them,

1066
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,104
the vibrations would reverberate

1067
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:12,314
through all of them.

1068
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:15,442
Even with a superpowered
construction team,

1069
01:11:15,526 --> 01:11:18,487
the task of organizing
a project on this scale--

1070
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,073
You forget, we have Batman.

1071
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:26,370
So, I was right about the coffee, huh?

1072
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:30,415
-(bubbling)
-(whale song)

1073
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:01,697
-(rumbles)
-(grunts)

1074
01:12:25,137 --> 01:12:26,471
(whirring)

1075
01:12:34,938 --> 01:12:36,190
(The Flash groaning)

1076
01:12:45,824 --> 01:12:47,409
(rumbling)

1077
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,538
(groaning)

1078
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,135
(groans)

1079
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:13,727
Hey, uh, Clark,

1080
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,854
I've been meaning to ask you,

1081
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:18,649
when you saw Lois at the party...

1082
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:22,444
Yes. There was a Lois on my world.

1083
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,447
She was a real firecracker.

1084
01:13:26,031 --> 01:13:27,324
We were married for...

1085
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:29,952
We had a good run.

1086
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:31,578
Old age.

1087
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,872
I was heartbroken for a long time.

1088
01:13:33,956 --> 01:13:34,915
And Diana?

1089
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:38,252
Sometimes losing loved ones
gives people something in common.

1090
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:41,004
Someday, she'll lose me too.

1091
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:43,757
We're not immortal. She is.

1092
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,510
To lose everyone again and again...

1093
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,303
Great Scott.

1094
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:59,314
No! It can't. We had time.

1095
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,066
We were going to finish.

1096
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:03,777
Are you seeing this?

1097
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,612
It's impossible.

1098
01:14:05,696 --> 01:14:09,157
A wave, any kind of wave,
cannot just accelerate!

1099
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:12,870
I have borne witness
to the universe for millennia.

1100
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:16,039
Nothing I have seen would explain this.

1101
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:19,001
There's only one explanation.

1102
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:21,670
The anomaly became aware
of our plans and adapted.

1103
01:14:22,629 --> 01:14:23,672
Impossible.

1104
01:14:23,755 --> 01:14:26,300
It's a natural phenomenon,
not a sentient foe.

1105
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,596
I'm afraid we won't be around
long enough to find out.

1106
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:32,681
(energy crackling)

1107
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:36,977
(rumbling)

1108
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:41,690
(gasps)

1109
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:45,319
Wait, this is it.
There's nothing we can do.

1110
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,279
We just watch the world end?

1111
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:50,282
Run.

1112
01:14:51,116 --> 01:14:53,118
Run to her.

1113
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:02,252
(people screaming)

1114
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:07,925
This is Iris West for GBS News.

1115
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:11,678
The antimatter wave has somehow made
a huge leap closer to our world.

1116
01:15:11,762 --> 01:15:13,764
Collision is imminent
and the final defense towers

1117
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,224
remain unfinished.

1118
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,851
If you are a believer, pray.

1119
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:20,312
If you have loved ones, hold them close.

1120
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:21,813
-(gasps)
-(thunder rumbling)

1121
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:26,109
(screams)

1122
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:28,237
(rumbling)

1123
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:33,659
Iris. (sighs)

1124
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,662
I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.

1125
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:39,498
You were.

1126
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,502
You were late for every dinner,
every movie.

1127
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:47,089
But you were always right on time
when I needed you.

1128
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:55,597
(thunder rumbling)

1129
01:16:01,478 --> 01:16:02,688
I love you, Barry.

1130
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:10,863
No, I won't let you go.

1131
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:19,913
(grunts)

1132
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:24,334
(straining)

1133
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,548
Here. Here, let me get that.

1134
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:31,967
Don't you get all sexist on me.

1135
01:16:32,759 --> 01:16:34,928
You do your list and I'll do mine.

1136
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,514
Otherwise, we're never gonna finish.

1137
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:39,725
Yes, boss.

1138
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:44,313
-(metal screeches)
-(grunts)

1139
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:47,149
(groans)

1140
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:52,070
(weakly) Barry...

1141
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,826
-No.
-(groans)

1142
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:01,079
No. Iris. I'll get you home.

1143
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:03,707
(groans softly)

1144
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,126
I already am home...

1145
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,671
wherever you are.

1146
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:14,718
Iris, please.

1147
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:17,513
You can't leave me.

1148
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:20,849
(Iris) It's not for long.

1149
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:23,060
We're almost finished.

1150
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:27,731
Besides, we've had
the whole world all to ourselves

1151
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:28,941
all these years.

1152
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:32,486
We can't be greedy.

1153
01:17:33,987 --> 01:17:35,239
Iris. (sobs)

1154
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,951
This is the big one, Barry.

1155
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:45,415
(groaning) Don't... don't be late.

1156
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:49,086
(groans softly)

1157
01:17:57,719 --> 01:17:59,304
(Barry crying)

1158
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:13,277
(engine roaring)

1159
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:20,492
Contact Robin and Huntress.

1160
01:18:20,576 --> 01:18:21,660
(beeping)

1161
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:24,955
Is it as bad as it looks?

1162
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:30,210
Yes. I just want to say...

1163
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:35,257
Dad-- Bruce, it's okay.

1164
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:52,691
I already miss Iris very much.

1165
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:55,694
Yes. Me too.

1166
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:57,946
But it's not for long.

1167
01:18:59,072 --> 01:19:00,574
Yes, Barry.

1168
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:05,287
Even at this speed,
the wave moves and it is nearly here.

1169
01:19:06,496 --> 01:19:07,831
Will these things work?

1170
01:19:09,499 --> 01:19:11,376
I do not know.

1171
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,588
Do you have enough power
to light 'em up?

1172
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:15,714
Almost.

1173
01:19:15,797 --> 01:19:17,299
After all these years,

1174
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:18,509
almost enough.

1175
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:21,345
You'll have to drop down
into normal time.

1176
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:23,931
The towers can't operate at this speed.

1177
01:19:25,307 --> 01:19:27,309
Okay. You ready?

1178
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:30,646
I don't wanna cut this too close.

1179
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:33,524
Before we go...

1180
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:34,608
Barry?

1181
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:35,776
Yes, Amazo?

1182
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:40,614
Thank you for helping me
achieve my primary function.

1183
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,950
To prolong human life.

1184
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:45,911
Well, I guess you've done that
in a big way.

1185
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:47,955
If we don't blow up.

1186
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:53,126
-(electricity crackling)
-(rumbling)

1187
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:59,091
-(people screaming)
-(Wonder Woman) Look!

1188
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:00,843
The tower.

1189
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:03,595
Barry.

1190
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:05,389
It's finished.

1191
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:06,974
(thunderclap)

1192
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:10,143
Here goes nothing.

1193
01:20:17,693 --> 01:20:18,861
(machine whirring)

1194
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:23,407
-(exclaiming)
-(whirring intensifies)

1195
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,022
Earth-2 tower is powering up.

1196
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:59,193
(powering up)

1197
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,947
Earth-X tower coming online.

1198
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:05,032
(exclaiming)

1199
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,335
(beeping)

1200
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:23,842
All towers are now functional.

1201
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:33,185
-Will it be enough?
-Unknown.

1202
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:35,187
We'll find out.

1203
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,605
In ten,

1204
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:37,856
-nine...
-(screaming)

1205
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,193
...eight, seven,

1206
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:42,611
six,

1207
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,864
five, four,

1208
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:48,700
three, two,

1209
01:21:49,409 --> 01:21:50,702
one.

1210
01:21:50,786 --> 01:21:52,538
Contact with antimatter wave.

1211
01:21:52,621 --> 01:21:54,540
(rumbling)

1212
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:58,627
(The Flash screams)

1213
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:06,802
(grunting)

1214
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:14,268
(breathing heavily) Please... God...

1215
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:16,103
(people screaming)

1216
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:25,112
(cheers and applause)

1217
01:22:31,785 --> 01:22:32,911
(man) It's leaving!

1218
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:57,895
(both exclaiming)

1219
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:07,279
(satellite) The experiment
was a success, Monitor.

1220
01:23:09,448 --> 01:23:11,074
Astonishing.

1221
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:13,243
(male voice) You didn't believe
it could be done.

1222
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:16,997
No.

1223
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,876
Neither do I believe in you.

1224
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,378
(The Spectre) Yet you tried anyway.

1225
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:26,131
You hoped.

1226
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,469
Perhaps I did.

1227
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:31,470
(The Spectre) Interesting.

1228
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:35,766
It is said you cannot have hope
without faith.

1229
01:23:43,815 --> 01:23:45,484
(The Flash breathing heavily)

1230
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:53,992
(groaning)

1231
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:57,579
We did it.

1232
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,584
You see that, Amazo?

1233
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:05,838
We did it. What do you think...

1234
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:07,256
(gasps softly)

1235
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:12,177
(groaning)

1236
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:19,893
(The Spectre) He knew.

1237
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:22,813
In Amazo's last moment of existence,

1238
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:26,149
he knew he had helped save humanity.

1239
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:27,192
So...

1240
01:24:28,527 --> 01:24:29,486
You're Death?

1241
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,448
I am the Spectre, the Wrath of God.

1242
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:36,702
Death is... better looking.

1243
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:40,706
But you are right in thinking
that the end is close.

1244
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:41,915
Wrath, huh?

1245
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:43,876
Guess I'm in trouble.

1246
01:24:44,543 --> 01:24:48,380
You bear some responsibility
for all that has happened here.

1247
01:24:50,716 --> 01:24:53,260
Oh. How?

1248
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,679
It happened before the beginning,

1249
01:24:55,762 --> 01:25:00,142
but you have already paid a heavy price
for being unmoored in time.

1250
01:25:00,767 --> 01:25:04,062
Well, I'm ready for whatever.

1251
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,733
I just wish I could say goodbye.

1252
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:12,946
The Speed Force
still claims you its own.

1253
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,617
It will grant your farewells
before the end comes.

1254
01:25:18,202 --> 01:25:19,369
What does that mean?

1255
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,084
(electricity crackling)

1256
01:25:29,505 --> 01:25:30,589
(panting)

1257
01:25:30,672 --> 01:25:32,424
(yelling)

1258
01:25:43,101 --> 01:25:44,853
(water running)

1259
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:46,522
(electricity crackling)

1260
01:25:46,605 --> 01:25:47,814
The Flash...

1261
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:49,691
The Flash...

1262
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:51,318
It's the beginning.

1263
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,613
He said, "Before the beginning."

1264
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:57,950
Huh? Who's there?

1265
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:02,538
(thunder rumbling)

1266
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:20,430
It's... it's you, isn't it?

1267
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:22,432
Go back.

1268
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:23,851
You must go back.

1269
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:25,644
You must stop it.

1270
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,481
Go back...

1271
01:26:30,190 --> 01:26:31,525
to before the beginning.

1272
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:48,292
We can save you, like, five trips.

1273
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:49,918
What do you say?

1274
01:26:51,587 --> 01:26:53,505
Yeah, too bad Batman
and Superman are AWOL,

1275
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:54,840
or we'd give you them too.

1276
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:58,093
I have already teleported Batman,

1277
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:01,138
Superman and Wonder Woman
to the Monitor's satellite.

1278
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:03,098
They await us there.

1279
01:27:04,975 --> 01:27:06,435
Listen, Harbinger,

1280
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:08,854
I got a proposition for you.

1281
01:27:17,446 --> 01:27:19,156
(soft romantic music playing)

1282
01:27:42,930 --> 01:27:44,097
(glasses clink)

1283
01:28:06,078 --> 01:28:07,621
(glass clinks)

1284
01:28:16,463 --> 01:28:19,925
-(cheering)
-(woman) We did it.

1285
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:20,968
(man) Great job!

1286
01:28:30,602 --> 01:28:31,520
(groans)

1287
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,023
(both exclaiming)

1288
01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:38,110
(groaning)

1289
01:28:38,193 --> 01:28:40,487
Dawnstar? Are you okay?

1290
01:28:40,988 --> 01:28:44,700
I... I feel... weird.

1291
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:47,160
-(groans)
-(Supergirl) Monitor!

1292
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:50,455
(groaning)

1293
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,210
Brainy! Brainiac 5, come in!

1294
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:57,045
There's something wrong with Dawnstar.

1295
01:28:57,129 --> 01:28:58,463
She's vanishing.

1296
01:28:58,547 --> 01:28:59,715
You've got to help her!

1297
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:02,176
Kara...

1298
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:08,640
Brainy. No!

1299
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:12,644
It's not just her or me.

1300
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,730
The whole world, Kara.

1301
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:18,108
The universe, maybe. It's all vanishing.

1302
01:29:19,151 --> 01:29:20,235
What's happening?

1303
01:29:20,736 --> 01:29:21,862
How do I stop it?

1304
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:23,155
(groans)

1305
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:29,661
I think whatever happened back there
changed history.

1306
01:29:29,745 --> 01:29:33,290
My world, everything I know
never happened.

1307
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:35,209
A chrono-anomaly, I...

1308
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,211
I... I never really existed.

1309
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,214
Brainy. No!

1310
01:29:41,673 --> 01:29:43,509
But if you somehow remember me,

1311
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:45,093
know this...

1312
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:47,721
I loved you, Kara.

1313
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:49,431
(Supergirl crying) No!

1314
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:53,393
(sobbing)

1315
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,995
(somber music playing)
